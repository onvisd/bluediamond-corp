### Contentful Migration

This script will export the current production data from Contentful and import it into a development environment of your choice.

To run this script please do the following:
1. Run `npm i` (this uses `contentful-import` and `contentful-export`)
2. Ensure your `.env` file contains the necessary import, export, and cms token values.
2. Run `node migrate` to start the migration.

The script will create a file named `latest.json` with the `migrate` directory. This file contains the latest data that you've pulled from production. For each subsequent export you run, the current `latest.json` file is renamed via timestamp and moved to `migrate/archives`, while a new `latest.json` file is created.This ensure's that you have the ability to roll-back your environment if an error should occur. To do this you'd simply need to import the archived file instead of the `latest.json`.

If an error occurs during the migration - a file will be generated by contentful and placed in the `migrate/logs` directory.
