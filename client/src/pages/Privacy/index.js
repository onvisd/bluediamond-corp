        <p>This policy does <strong><u>not</u></strong> apply to information collected or obtained by any third party, including through any application or content (including advertising) that may link to or be accessible from or on the Sites.</p>
        <p>By accessing, browsing, or otherwise using the Sites, you acknowledge and consent to our collection and use of information as set forth in this Privacy Policy.

Please check back periodically as this Privacy Policy may change from time to time and your continued use of this Sites after we make any changes shall be deemed to be acceptance of those changes.</p>

        <h3>The Information We Collect</h3>
        <p></p>
        <p>The personal data that Blue Diamond Growers knowingly collects from persons in the EU is described at our EU website (<a href="https://www.bluediamondalmonds.co.uk" target="_blank" noopener noreferrer>www.bluediamondalmonds.co.uk</a>).</p>
        <p>The Sites are intended for a general audience, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If you are under the age of 13, you should not and may not provide any personal information to us through or on the Sites.</p>
        <p>We collect different types of information from and about Users of our Sites when you provide it and automatically as you navigate through the Sites.</p>

            <li>Information from which you may be personally identified may be collected from you when you register for the Sites (your email address) and when you order online (your name, shipping and billing addresses, payment information, telephone number, e-mail address, credit card information, and preferred shipping methods). We may also ask you for such information when you enter a contest or promotion sponsored by us, and when you report a problem with our Sites or when you contact us for customer service.  When you request a shipment be made to someone else, for example as a gift, we also collect the recipient's name and address.</li>
            <li>Information collected automatically as you access or navigate through the Sites may include IP address, geolocation, time spent on the site and on individual pages, browser and device information, user flow information (i.e., navigation from page-to-page) and the referring URLs, if they are available.

            <li>You may also provide information to be published or posted on public areas of the Sites, or transmitted to other users of the Sites or to third parties (e.g., product reviews) (collectively, "User Contributions"). Your User Contributions are posted on the Sites and transmitted to others at your own risk.

We may use that information to contact you in relation to the subject of your User Message.
